        This week we had the chance of interviewing two creative artists from
        Germany. These guys are simply amazing at what they do with the
        European fashion scene and this year at Paris Fashion Week they
        introduced their new collection.

        Just amazing! That is how i can describe this person. So creative,so in
        spiring. I was watching her create in her small studio in London and i
        was amazed at how every little detail gets included in her creaions.
        From frames,to glass thickness she blew me away...
